          This isn't a car. It's ends here. I'll be standing where l belong.
          Between you and the people of Gotham. I'm Batman My anger outweights
          my guilt. Does it come in black? Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the
          whole thing was your idea.

          It was a dog. It was a big dog. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the

          Swear to me! Does it come in black? Someone like you. Someone who'll

          Hero can be anyone. Even a man knowing something as simple and
          reassuring as putting a coat around a young boy shoulders to let him
          know the world hadn't ended. This isn't a car. It's ends here.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's ends here. I'm not wearing hockey pads. Someone like you. Someone
          who'll rattle the cages. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the
          cages. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost
          many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when
          I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of
          success. But I never became one of them.
